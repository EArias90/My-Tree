# My-Tree

## Concept: 

Growing up, I would always remember spending my New Year's or summer breaks away from Massachusettes. Both my parents were born/raised in Peru and did not have a lot of Family here. They migrated to the US in the '80s for a better life. Every time we would have a school vacation, my parents would find it as another opportunity to go to visit Peru.


During our visits, I would always meet some new family members. They kiss my siblings and I's cheeks then remanence on how big we have grown. We didn't mind because they would follow up with stories such as their upbringings. 


With everything going on in the world now, there is always that uncertainty about who we would see anymore. I wanted to create an app where stories can not only be stored but also shared. 

## Technologies Used:

## Approach: 

With this project, I wanted to break certain tasks into different days. I created a 'Project Scedule' document on Google Drive to focus on a certain task and also with organization. There would be certain sections I would spend more time then others. I feel this is a great method to show where I need to focus more for future projects.

## Challenges: 

There were a couple of challenges with creating this app. I wanted to add some more features such as a Google Maps feature where a user could point out where an event happened. I also wanted to add a picture feature. The user would be able to add a photo of a certain location, person, etc.

## Additional information: 

This is not the finished product. I enjoyed the time making this app especially the Authentication. It is something I would comeback in a couple of days and add the features I was unable to.
